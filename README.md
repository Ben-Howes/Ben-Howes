### About Me

I am a PhD Student at Imperial College London working on Macroecology and Community Ecology, specifically looking at how deforesation impacts ecological communities.

I have experience using a multitude of approaches to uncover ecological patters and processes, ranging from Complex Systems modelling of ecological communities, to identifying macroecological patterns of species distributions using range and land-use datasets. I am currently working on combining Complex Systems with Metabolic Theory to create a 'Digital Twin' of real world ecological communities, aiming to understand how some populations of species are more resilient to habitat loss and climate change than others.
